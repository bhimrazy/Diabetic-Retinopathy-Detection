## Downloading and Preprocessing Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset:

> Note: You can skip this entire step, as this studio already has it done for you.

In this step, we'll walk through the process of downloading and preprocessing the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset. This dataset is commonly used for developing algorithms to identify diabetic retinopathy in eye images.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Kaggle API key (Get one [here](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2Faccount%2Flogin%3Fphase%3Dregister))
- `kaggle` library installed (`pip install kaggle`)

**Note:** Before proceeding with the steps below, make sure to change your current directory to `dr-detection` and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:
```bash
cd dr-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 1: Download the Dataset

There are two ways to download the dataset:

### First Way: Downloading as a Complete Zip File

```bash
kaggle competitions download -c diabetic-retinopathy-detection

# Extract
unzip diabetic-retinopathy-detection.zip -d data/diabetic-retinopathy-detection
rm diabetic-retinopathy-detection.zip
```

### Second Way: Downloading as Parts

```bash
./scripts/download-dr-dataset.sh

# Merge and extract the parts
./scripts/merge_and_extract.sh
```

## Step 2: Preprocess Images

Once the dataset is downloaded, preprocess the images to crop and resize them.

  <p style="text-align:center;">Example of cropping and resizing</p>
</div>

```bash
python scripts/crop_and_resize.py --src data/diabetic-retinopathy-dataset/train data/diabetic-retinopathy-dataset/resized/train
python scripts/crop_and_resize.py --src data/diabetic-retinopathy-dataset/test data/diabetic-retinopathy-dataset/resized/test
```

## Step 3: Split Data and Save to CSV

Finally, split the data into train and validation sets and save them to CSV files.

```bash
python scripts/split_dataset.py
```
